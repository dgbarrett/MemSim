About:

MemSim simulates four memory allocation strategies in a 128 "byte" simulation of main memory.  The four allocation strategies used are best fit, next fit, worst fit, and first fit.  The program takes an input file of the form:

	---------------------------------
	item_name(char) item_size(int)
	...
	---------------------------------

	Ex.
	---------------------------------
	A 10
	B 20
	C 3
	F 223
	...
	---------------------------------

Processes are added to memory according to the appropraiate allocation strategy, when no room remains in memory the oldest process is swapped out to make room.  The simulation runs all 4 memory strategies on each test file to compare the effectiveness of each strategy across different data sets.

How to Run:

- type 'make MemSim'
- type './holes testfile'
